# EV-V2X-Data-Reading-CANbus
The battery of an electrical vehicle (EV) can be used to support the power grid (V2G, Vehicle to Grid) or can act as a buffer for a home promoting self-consumption (V2H, Vehicle to Home). This technical report evaluates, in laboratory conditions and for different charging/discharging power levels, the round-trip efficiency of an EV and V2G/V2H charger setup.
